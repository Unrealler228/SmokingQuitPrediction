# SmokingQuitPrediction
This is a machine learning project. Main goal is to predict the probability of quiting smoking based on human health.
This project is a solution for [ML olympiad](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-smoking).
I have 0.9872 ROC AUC on the final submition and it equals 29th place.
I consider it an average result so I need to improve my skills to achieve better place.
