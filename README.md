# SmokingQuitPrediction
The machine learning project. Main goal is to predict the probability of quiting smoking based on human health.
This project is a solution for [ML olympiad](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-smoking).
Currently I'm placed 12th with 0.98996 ROC AUC. Aiming for top 10.
I'm happy for any suggestion on how to improve my result.
